# CADET
```
WARNING: Yet Another Final Exam Project...
```
This is a pathetically written CAD software packed with minimum set of functions, which will never be capable of being used in real production.  

CADET is based on Easy Graphic Engine (aka EGE), a graphic library written in C++. However the teacher asked us to finish the project using C, so this project has **NOT** taken much advantage of OOP features, such as classes.
